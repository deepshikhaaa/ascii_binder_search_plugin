# AsciiBinder Search Plugin

## What is this?
This is a small plugin that generates a data.json which contains the content and title of each page and puts it in each distro. This file is indexed and searched with search template client side. This plugin provides a default search template that is ready to use, but if you want you can use your own search template. See the instructions below.
